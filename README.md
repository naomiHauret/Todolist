# Todolist

Here's a simple todolist app designed and coded all by myself with the framework CodeIgniter and with a PostgreSQL database.
PLEASE NOTE THAT:

You must edit the config/database.php and config/config.php files if you want to re-use this code.
You'll also have to create the PostgreSQL database "projetphp" and the schema "prjweb". I commited the script for the tables. 

You can take a look at what the app looks like on my CodePen:
